# Msg_XXxx-Script-BOTW
Simple script to speed up editing the Msg_XXxx.pack and the internal .sscar files


# Reqirements
sarc from https://github.com/leoetlino/sarc
Seting up the correct paths in the file

# What it does
It uses sarc to extract pack and sscar files for editing the ingame text data.
It then repacks the sscar files and will repack the pack file siting in Cemu's graphicsPack folder
This allows for Cemu to then be launched directly into game if desired in order to test the results.
